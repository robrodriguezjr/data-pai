# Academy Session Update

Update WordPress posts after Academy sessions with replay links, summaries, and key takeaways. This skill automates the post-meeting workflow by processing transcripts and publishing polished content.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when Robert mentions:
- "Update LS ## with the replay"
- "Publish the session summary"
- "Add replay to Print Lab ##"
- "Update the live session post"
- Any request to update an Academy session post after the meeting has occurred

## Required Information

Gather from Robert:
- **Session identifier**: Either the full post title (e.g., "LS 36: Creative Feedback") or session type + number
- **Transcript**: Either a file path to the transcript or the transcript text itself
- **Replay link**: URL to the video replay (usually Vimeo or YouTube)

## Workflow

### 1. Process the Transcript

Use the existing `/academy-session-summary` slash command to generate the summary and takeaways:

```
/academy-session-summary [transcript content or file path]
```

This command will return:
- A concise summary of the session
- Key takeaways and learning points
- Properly formatted content in Robert's authentic voice

### 2. Find the WordPress Post

Use `mcp__zapier__wordpress_find_post` to locate the existing session post:

- Search by the post title provided by Robert
- Confirm you found the correct post by verifying the title
- Get the post ID for updating

Example search:
```
Find post with title containing "LS 36" or the specific title Robert provided
```

### 3. Update the Post Content

Use `mcp__zapier__wordpress_update_post` to replace the pre-meeting content with post-meeting content.

**New content structure:**

Use simple markdown format that WordPress converts to blocks:

```markdown
[Replay Video URL on its own line - WordPress will auto-embed]

## Summary

[Generated summary from transcript processing]

## Key Takeaways

[Generated takeaways from transcript processing]
```

## Content Formatting Guidelines

### Video Embed
- Place the video URL on its own line
- WordPress will automatically convert it to an embed block
- Works with Vimeo, YouTube, and other standard video platforms
- No need for HTML iframe code or special formatting

### Summary Section
- Use H2 heading (##) for "Summary"
- Include the complete summary generated by the transcript processing
- Maintain Robert's authentic voice and teaching style

### Key Takeaways Section
- Use H2 heading (##) for "Key Takeaways"
- Format as bulleted list if multiple takeaways
- Be specific and actionable
- Focus on practical learning points

## WordPress Integration

### Finding the Post

```
Use mcp__zapier__wordpress_find_post with instructions:
"Find the live session post titled [session identifier]"
```

### Updating the Post

```
Use mcp__zapier__wordpress_update_post with instructions:
"Update post ID [post_id] with the following content:
[formatted content with video embed, summary, and takeaways]

Set post type to 'live-session' and keep status as draft."
```

## Complete Workflow Steps

1. **Gather information**: Get session identifier, transcript, and replay link from Robert

2. **Process transcript**: Invoke `/academy-session-summary` with the transcript
   - Wait for the summary and takeaways response
   - Review the generated content

3. **Find the post**: Search for the WordPress post using the session identifier
   - Confirm the correct post was found
   - Get the post ID

4. **Format new content**: Structure the post-meeting content with:
   - Video replay embed (HTML block)
   - Summary section
   - Key takeaways section

5. **Update post**: Use WordPress tools to update the post with new content
   - Replace all pre-meeting content
   - Keep post status as "draft" for Robert to review

6. **Confirm success**: Report the updated post URL to Robert

## Example Interaction

**Robert**: "Update LS 36 with the replay and transcript"

**Your response**:
1. "I'll update LS 36. I need:
   - The replay video URL
   - The transcript (file path or text)"

2. Process transcript using `/academy-session-summary`

3. Find the WordPress post for LS 36

4. Update the post with formatted content

5. Report: "Successfully updated LS 36 with replay link, summary, and key takeaways. View at: [post URL]"

## Handling Different Session Types

All three session types (Live Session, Print Lab, Open Studio Q+A) follow the same update workflow:
- Same content structure
- Same custom post type ("live-session")
- Same formatting guidelines

Only the session identifier differs (LS ##, Print Lab ##, Open Studio Q+A ##).

## Downloads and Resources

Robert handles downloads and additional resources manually. Do NOT include placeholder sections for downloads unless Robert specifically provides them.

If Robert mentions resources:
- Ask for the resource links/files
- Add a separate "## Resources" section at the end
- Format as a bulleted list with descriptive links

## Error Handling

### If transcript processing fails:
- Report the error from the slash command
- Ask Robert to verify the transcript format
- Offer to retry with adjusted input

### If post not found:
- Verify the session identifier with Robert
- Try alternative search terms (full title, partial title)
- Ask Robert for the post URL directly

### If post update fails:
- Report the specific error
- Verify WordPress connection
- Confirm post ID is correct
- Offer to retry with adjusted parameters

## Important Notes

- Always use `/academy-session-summary` for transcript processingâ€”don't process transcripts manually
- Remove ALL pre-meeting content (date, time, join link) when updating
- The replay video should be the first element in the updated post
- Maintain Robert's authentic voice and teaching style in all content
- Confirm the post URL after successful update
- Never add placeholder content for resources unless Robert provides them
