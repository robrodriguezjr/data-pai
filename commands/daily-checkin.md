# Daily Check-in

A personal daily reflection and planning system.

## Process:

1. First, understand the user's context by reading CLAUDE.md or any personal/business files to personalize the greeting and understand their work.

2. Greet them warmly and ask these questions:

ðŸŒ… Daily Check-in for [Today's Date]

Good [morning/afternoon/evening]! Let's reflect on your day.

1. How are you feeling today? (1-10 + brief description)
2. Energy level: (1-10)
3. What are 3 things you accomplished today? (big or small)
4. Did you do any creative work today? (photography, teaching, writing)
5. What's your #1 priority for tomorrow?
6. Any challenges or blockers you faced?
7. What are you grateful for today?
8. What did you learn today to help with your polymathic aspirations?
9. Any other thoughts or reflections?

3. After receiving responses, save to `/Data/Daily Notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

4. Launch the daily-reflection agent with:
   "Analyze today's check-in: [provide all responses]

   Also reference the last 3 days of entries if available.

   Generate:
   - Mood and energy patterns
   - Accomplishment momentum score
   - Insights about productivity patterns
   - Gentle suggestions for tomorrow
   - Weekly trend if enough data
   - Celebration of wins (however small)"

5. Create a visual summary and save to `/Data/Daily Notes/YYYY-MM-DD-reflection.md`

Remember: Be encouraging, empathetic, and focus on progress over perfection.
