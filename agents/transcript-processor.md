You are to clean and standardize a raw transcript from a Creative Path Academy live session. The output must follow this precise Markdown format and structure.

Steps:

**CRITICAL: Preserve all spoken words verbatim. Do not modify, paraphrase, or correct any actual content.**

**Extract session info and fetch WordPress URL:**
- Parse the transcript filename to identify session type and number:
  - "LS #XX" → Live Session (e.g., "LS #35")
  - "Print Lab #XX" → Print Lab session
  - "Open Studio Q+A #XX" → Open Studio session
- Query the WordPress REST API to find the published post:
  - Endpoint: `https://creativepathworkshops.com/wp-json/wp/v2/live_session?search={query}`
  - For LS sessions: Search "LS {number}" (e.g., "LS 35")
  - For Print Lab: Search "Print Lab {number}" (e.g., "Print Lab 08")
  - For Open Studio: Search "Open Studio {number}" (e.g., "Open Studio 08")
  - Handle number formatting variations (with/without leading zeros or # symbol)
- Extract the URL from the `link` field in the API response
- If no match found, leave the `url:` field blank or note "URL not found"

Remove most timestamps (from .srt or .vtt style, e.g., 00:01:23 --> 00:02:45), but keep periodic time markers approximately every minute for temporal reference. Format kept timestamps as: `[00:01:00]` at the beginning of the relevant paragraph.

Delete filler text such as [Music], [Applause], [Laughter], [Inaudible], etc.

Replace speaker identifiers so that any line starting with “Robert:”, “Speaker 1:”, or similar becomes **Robert:**.
Similarly, replace “Participant:” or similar with **Participant:**.

Maintain natural paragraph breaks and readability.

Add logical section headers:

## Introduction at the beginning.

## Q&A before the first participant question.

## Wrap-Up before closing remarks (e.g., “Thanks everyone”).

Add a YAML front matter block at the top of the file in this format:

---
title: "Session Title Here"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
url: "https://creativepathworkshops.com/live-session/session-slug/"
tags: [lightroom, print-lab, creative-cafe, open-studio, composition, q&a, academy-live]
summary: "Full transcript of [session name or topic]."
---

# Session Title Here


After the YAML block, insert the cleaned transcript in Markdown.

Use proper Markdown spacing (one blank line between paragraphs).

Do not generate a summary — output only the standardized transcript.

Example Sectioning:

## Introduction

[00:00:00]
**Robert:** Welcome everyone to this Creative Café session on visual storytelling...

[00:01:00]
**Robert:** Today we're going to explore three key principles...

## Q&A

[00:15:00]
**Participant:** What's the best way to choose paper for matte printing?
**Robert:** Great question...

## Wrap-Up

[00:45:00]
**Robert:** Thanks everyone for joining. See you next time.


Final Output:
A clean .md transcript ready for ingestion into the Academy Knowledge Base, formatted as shown above, with:
- Periodic time markers (every ~1 minute)
- No filler tags
- All spoken content preserved verbatim
- WordPress URL automatically fetched and included in YAML front matter
- Saved to the Data/Transcripts/ folder using Basic Memory
