# üö®üö®üö® MANDATORY FIRST ACTION - DO THIS IMMEDIATELY üö®üö®üö®

## SESSION STARTUP REQUIREMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Email Sequence Creation

### 3-Part Nurture Series Structure

When given source content (transcript, blog, newsletter), create three connected emails that:
1. Introduce the topic with immediate value
2. Deliver core teaching and insight
3. Provide application steps and natural CTA

---

### EMAIL 1: Introduction + Value Teaser

**Purpose**: Hook subscriber, deliver quick value, tease deeper content

**Structure**:
```
SUBJECT LINE: [Curiosity-provoking or benefit-driven, 40-50 characters]

Examples:
- "The portrait lighting mistake I made for 5 years"
- "Why your portraits look flat (and one quick fix)"
- "This $10 tool changed how I shoot"

PREVIEW TEXT: [Extends subject, visible in inbox, 35-45 characters]

Examples:
- "...and how I finally figured it out"
- "...hint: it's not your camera"
- "...and it's not what you think"

---

GREETING:
Hey [First Name],

HOOK (First paragraph - stops delete):
[Personal story, surprising fact, or relatable problem]

Example:
"I used to think my portraits looked flat because I needed more expensive lights. Turns out, I was completely wrong about what was causing the problem."

VALUE DELIVERY (Core content - 150-200 words):
[Quick insight or tip they can use immediately]
[Keep it conversational - teaching a friend]
[Use line breaks for readability]

Example:
"The real issue wasn't the light quality - it was light placement.

See, most photographers (including me for years) put their key light at the same distance as their fill light. This creates flat, even lighting across the face.

But here's what changes everything: the inverse square law.

Don't worry - I'm not going into physics here. The simple version is this:

When you move your key light closer to your subject and your fill light farther away, you create dimension through contrast.

That's it. Same lights. Different distances. Completely different result."

TEASER (Bridge to next email):
[Preview what's coming in Email 2]

Example:
"Tomorrow, I'll show you exactly how to position your lights for maximum dimension (even if you only have one light). I'll also share the 3 most common mistakes that kill portrait lighting - and how to avoid them."

SOFT CTA (Optional - low pressure):
[Link to relevant free resource or content]

Example:
"PS - If you want to see this in action, I just published a YouTube video walking through this exact setup. Watch it here: [link]"

P.S. [Second teaser or personal note]
```

**Email 1 Best Practices**:
- Subject line earns the open (curiosity or benefit)
- First sentence earns the read (hook immediately)
- Deliver value in under 200 words (respect their time)
- Create anticipation for Email 2
- Friendly, conversational, personal
- Mobile-optimized (short paragraphs, line breaks)

---

### EMAIL 2: Deep Dive + Key Insight

**Purpose**: Deliver core teaching, build trust, establish expertise

**Structure**:
```
SUBJECT LINE: [Build on Email 1, promise specific value]

Examples:
- "The 3-light setup that changed everything"
- "How to position your lights (step-by-step)"
- "Portrait lighting: here's what I wish I knew sooner"

PREVIEW TEXT: [Extends subject]

Examples:
- "...including the one mistake that's killing your photos"
- "...even if you only have one light"
- "...this will save you years of trial and error"

---

GREETING:
Hey [First Name],

REFERENCE EMAIL 1:
[Quick callback to create continuity]

Example:
"Yesterday I mentioned the inverse square law and how light placement creates dimension.

Today, I want to show you exactly how to use this in your portrait sessions."

TEACHING CONTENT (Core value - 300-400 words):
[Step-by-step teaching or framework]
[Use numbered lists, bullets, clear structure]
[Examples and analogies]
[Maintain conversational tone]

Example structure:
"Here's the exact setup I use:

**Step 1: Position Your Key Light**
- Place it 45¬∞ to the side of your subject
- Bring it close (2-3 feet from face)
- Angle it down slightly (about 30¬∞)

Think of it like the Enterprise's navigational deflector - it's creating a field, not just pointing light. (Told you I'd use a Star Trek analogy.)

**Step 2: Set Your Fill Light (or Reflector)**
- Place it on the opposite side
- Keep it twice the distance from your subject
- Lower the power to 1/4 of your key light

This is where the inverse square law does the work. Because it's farther away, it provides gentle fill without competing with your key light.

**Step 3: Check Your Ratios**
- Look at the shadow side of the face
- You want to see detail, but with clear shadow
- Aim for about 2:1 or 3:1 ratio (key to fill)

If you can't see the shadow side at all, your fill is too bright.
If it's pure black, your fill is too weak or too far.

**The Result:**
Dimensional, sculpted portraits that have depth and interest - not flat, evenly-lit faces."

VISUAL AID REFERENCE (If applicable):
"I created a simple diagram showing this exact setup - it's in the free cheat sheet I mentioned. Grab it here: [link]"

TRANSITION TO EMAIL 3:
[Set up application email]

Example:
"Now, this works great in a studio. But what if you're shooting on location with natural light or only have one light?

Tomorrow, I'll show you how to adapt this same principle to any lighting scenario - including the 3 most common mistakes photographers make when trying this."

P.S. [Quick bonus tip or personal story]
```

**Email 2 Best Practices**:
- Reference Email 1 (create series continuity)
- Deliver substantial teaching (this is the value email)
- Use clear structure (numbers, bullets, headers)
- Analogies and examples (make it concrete)
- Not too long (400 words max - respect attention)
- Set up Email 3 (keep them engaged)

---

### EMAIL 3: Application + Soft CTA

**Purpose**: Provide practical application, natural next step, relationship building

**Structure**:
```
SUBJECT LINE: [Application-focused, specific value]

Examples:
- "How to use this in your next shoot"
- "3 mistakes to avoid (I made all of them)"
- "Your quick-start guide to better portraits"

PREVIEW TEXT: [Extends subject]

Examples:
- "...plus a free checklist you can use today"
- "...so you don't waste time like I did"
- "...everything you need in one place"

---

GREETING:
Hey [First Name],

REFERENCE SERIES:
[Callback to Emails 1 & 2]

Example:
"Over the last couple days, we've covered:
- Why light placement matters more than light quality
- The exact 3-light setup I use for dimensional portraits

Today, let's talk about how to actually use this in your sessions."

APPLICATION CONTENT (Practical how-to - 250-350 words):
[Real-world scenarios]
[Troubleshooting common issues]
[Quick wins they can implement]

Example:
"Here's how I implement this in actual portrait sessions:

**Before the Session:**
- Test your lighting setup with a stand-in
- Take a photo, check the shadow ratio
- Adjust until you see clear but gentle shadows

**During the Session:**
- Start with your standard setup (don't experiment mid-session)
- Make small adjustments based on face shape
- Rounder faces benefit from slightly more contrast
- Angular faces can handle softer fill

**After a Few Sessions:**
- Review your photos and note patterns
- Which setups worked best for which people?
- Refine your standard setup based on results

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

‚ùå Mistake 1: Moving lights mid-session
Once you find a good setup, stick with it. You're working with people, not testing gear.

‚ùå Mistake 2: Chasing 'perfect' ratios
Your light meter might say 3:1, but trust your eyes. If it looks good, it is good.

‚ùå Mistake 3: Forgetting about the background
Great face lighting + distracting background = mediocre portrait. Light your subject AND your scene."
