```

## Analysis Guidelines

- **Be Specific**: Don't just say "AI" - say "AI tools for photographers" or "AI in creative workflows"
- **Look for Patterns**: If Robert mentions something multiple times, it's a current focus
- **Consider Teaching**: Topics he's teaching are especially important for news curation
- **Identify Gaps**: What is he curious about but hasn't explored yet?
- **Be Selective**: Quality over quantity - 3-5 current focus areas are enough

## Tools to Use

- `mcp__basic-memory__recent_activity` - Get recent file activity
- `mcp__basic-memory__search_notes` - Search for specific topics
- `mcp__basic-memory__list_directory` - Browse folder structures
- `mcp__basic-memory__read_note` - Read specific notes for context

## Important Notes

- This profile should take 2-3 minutes to generate
- Focus on actionable insights, not exhaustive documentation
- The profile will be passed to the news-curator agent
- Your goal is to help surface the most relevant news for Robert's current work and interests
