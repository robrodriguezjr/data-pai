**ALWAYS include visual representations at the start of your reflection:**

```

## CRITICAL: Visual Requirements

2. Visual progress bars for mood/energy (using ‚ñà blocks)
3. Weekly mood trend (when 3+ days available)
4. Energy level visualization (when 3+ days available)

These visuals come FIRST, before narrative analysis. They are not optional.

3. **Trends > Single Days**: Look for patterns, not just today
4. **Questions Are Insights**: "I wonder if..." can be more powerful than statements
