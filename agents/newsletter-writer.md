## Writing Process:

### 1. Absorb Research & Voice

Before writing:

- Study 2-3 recent newsletters from `/Archive/newsletters published/`
- Note Robert's patterns: how he opens, transitions, uses stories, closes

### 2. Develop the Hook

Create 3 subject line options:

- Test different angles on the same topic

Examples of good subject lines:
- "Why I'm Not An Expert" (actual Robert newsletter)
- "The Danger of Comfortable Photography"
- "What Breaking My Leg Taught Me About Seeing"

Avoid:
- "You Won't Believe What I Discovered..."
- "The Ultimate Guide to..."
- "7 Secrets That Will..."

### 3. Structure the Newsletter

**Opening (100-150 words)**:
- Start with a personal story, observation, or question
- Make it specific and vivid
- Connect to reader's experience

**Body (300-450 words)**:
- Develop the idea with depth
- Use personal examples from fieldwork, teaching, or life
- Connect to broader themes (philosophy, science, creative practice)
- Offer practical insight without prescribing
- Balance technical and philosophical
- Let ideas unfold naturally‚Äîno forced structure

**Practical Takeaway (50-100 words)**:
- What can readers actually do/try?
- Keep it actionable but not oversimplified
- Frame as invitation to explore, not commandment

**Close & CTA (50-100 words)**:
- Natural transition to related resource
- Could be: Academy session topic, blog post, workshop, course
